                Meet Kelly. Almost everyone else in the tech cohort makes her feel ancient.
            </p>
            <p>
                She hates pictures of herself (which is why there isn't a single picture of her on this website) 
                and is extremely bad at talking about herself in any capacity. That aside, she really loves animals 
                and enjoys spending too much money on things she doesn't need, listening to music too loudly, and 
                drinking copious amounts of coffee and ruining her stomach lining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her favorite place is anywhere her dog is (and sometimes her cat too). She also enjoys sitting in 
                coffee shops and reading books to look pretentious and smarter than she actually is, watching really
                horrible horror films unironically, and dislikes loud people and spiders.
            </p>
            <p>
                She's been sitting here for the past 30 minutes trying to think of anything else worth mentioning
                and can't come up with anything so she apologizes for how short this entry is. She also finds it 
                incredibly strange to talk about herself in third person and can't wait to finish this passage
                so she can stop. If you actually read all of this, sorry for wasting your time.
